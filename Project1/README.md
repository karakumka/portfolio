# PCA from Scratch

In this project, we analyze the publicly available **Taxi Trips (2013-2023)** dataset taken from the [Chicago Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Taxi-Trips-2013-2023-/wrvz-psew/about_data). Due to the size of this dataset, we filtered only the trips that occurred during April 2023.

The project discusses:
- The choice between using covariance or correlation matrices in the PCA method, depending on the nature of the data.
- Different methods for discarding principal components, including a comparison of their effectiveness.
- Practical interpretation of the first two principal components.
- The stability of the PCA results.
